<p>   One reason that I have this opinion is that Venus can be a better option. For one, Venus is slightly closer to Earth than Mars; although this fact may seem inconsequential, it really isn’t. You don’t need to store as much food, water and fuel, since the trip will be shorter. Additionally, this video (Should We Colonize Venus Instead of Mars? - YouTube) by PBS Space Time says that “Shorter trips means less weightlessness and radiation(the trip will be more comfortable)...” Another benefit of Venus is that it is similar in size to Earth. This means that Venus has a very similar gravity to Earth, which is pretty much required for long-term survival on space colonies. Humans are not adapted for survival in low-gravity environments like Mars. As a result, humans can suffer all sorts of medical issues like bone loss, even with the best precautions and countermeasures available today. PBS explains that “Terraforming(Mars) seems silly if people couldn’t even live there for more than a few months without their bones falling apart.”
